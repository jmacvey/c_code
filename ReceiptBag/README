-----------------------------------------------------------

The ReceiptBag program utilizes a simple Bag data structure
to implement a receipt system.  The system is represented
using parallel arrays, wherein one array stores boolean
values corresponding to validated receipts for items in the other
array.  These items can thus be cross-referenced by index, which
act as the item's unique integer receipt.  Items can be tracked,
validated, and stored in the data structure using this method.

Note: The BagInterface header file is provided by F. Cerrano 
in Walls and Mirrors, 6e.  

EXECUTABLE_NAME: ReceiptBag

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, recursive
problem solving, user input handling, class relationships,
static variable initialization,  etc. This program was intended
as a learning exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for
industrial practices which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
