------------------README: LISTADT--------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

The List ADT represents my version the List data structure.
Both the array and the linked-node list are represented here.
This is where I first began implementing "The Big 3"-- copy constructor,
destructor, and copy assignment operator, on a regular basis. 
Copy elision is used effectively here, as are iterators.  

The ListInterface file is that found in F. Cerrano's Walls an Mirrors, 6e.
Other files are a mix of both Cerrano and my own implementation details.  
 
Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, copy elision,
memory management, etc. This program was intended as a learning
exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for industrial practices
which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
