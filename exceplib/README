-----------------------------------------------------------

exceplib (exception library) is a static library used in many programs.
It simply implements multiple exceptions for driver files of
other programs.  These driver files only need to include the library,
link it (via the g++ Makefile), and developers can use this code
without rewriting it.
  
EXECUTABLE_NAME: n/a
