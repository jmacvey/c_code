-----------------------------------------------------------

The MusicPlayer program provides the user a simplified 
database for storing compact disc information, including
track names, artists, disc names, play times, etc. Most of the
data is represented with Linked Sorted Lists.  All input is
thoroughly verified.  Memory is managed intimately, as the 
program deals primarily with raw pointers.   

EXECUTABLE_NAME: MusicX

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, recursive
problem solving, user input handling, class relationships,
static variable initialization,  etc. This program was intended
as a learning exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for
industrial practices which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
