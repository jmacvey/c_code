------------------README: Sorts----------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

This directory holds a header file containing inline implementations of
various sorting algorithms.  Everything from BubbleSort to QuickSort is
included here, and Big Theta algorithm analysis is applied to all (see
the files).  These algorithms are common to most programmers, so I can't
take credit for their invention.  I did, however, write them myself after
understanding how they operate.

EXECUTABLE_NAME: SortTester

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, recursive
problem solving, user input handling, class relationships,
static variable initialization,  etc. This program was intended
as a learning exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for
industrial practices which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
