-----------------------------------------------------------

eslib (exit script library) is a static library used in many programs.
It simply implements an exitScript for testing driver files of
other programs.  These driver files only need to include the library,
link it (via the g++ Makefile), and developers can use this code
without rewriting it.
  
EXECUTABLE_NAME: test (simply tests the function)
