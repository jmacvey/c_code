------------------README: MAZE-----------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

What does every novice programmer who is interested in games
write?  A 2D maze? What does every weird kid who likes Math and
computation and games write? A self-solving maze.  This program
is another use of recursive backtracking to solve a 2-D maze
with a given set of information. That information is provided
in a file, the program reads that file, and then executes
recursion techniques.  This was one of the programming problems
found in Cerrano's Walls and Mirrors, 6e (no source code was
provided).  This was the closest I got to "Game Design" in a
long time.  It was a huge boost to my confidence as a programmer,
and so I again must share it with the world.  Behold, everyone,
a maze represented by ASCII characters!  Voila!
   
EXECUTABLE_NAME: Maze

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, recursive
problem solving, file stream handling, and class relationships,
static variable initialization,  etc. This program was intended
as a learning exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for
industrial practices which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
