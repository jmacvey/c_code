-----------------------------------------------------------

Ahh, the ubiquitous Calculator program.  Every novice programmer
builds a primitive calculator, amiright?  This program uses
a few clases of my own along with basic Stack algorithms to 
produce both an Infix and PostFix calculator.  The Postfix handles
multi-digits and the 4 basic mathematical operators.  The infix
handles single digits and those same operators.  Users choose to
enter or not enter.  Beware:  The code isn't exception safe, and I
don't check for valid input.  This means you'll get a nasty seg fault
on the output if you try to enter a bad Postfix expression in postfix mode,
or a bad infix expression in infix mode.  A fun game I like to play
is to input as many such expressions as possible without getting a seg
fault.  My current record is 42, and I'm completely kidding.

Well, enjoy!

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, copy elision,
memory management, etc. This program was intended as a learning
exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for industrial practices
which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
