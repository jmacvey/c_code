This directory holds the files for two implementations of the 
Queue data structure.  In particular, implementation is provided
for circular array queues as well as linked queues.

The QueueInterface file is that found in F. Cerrano's Walls
and Mirrors, 6e.  The LinkedQueue files are a blend of both Cerrano and
my own code.  The CircularArrayQueue is the more interesting of the two,
and all of that code is my own implementation.


EXECUTABLE_NAME: QueueTester

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, recursive
problem solving, user input handling, class relationships,
static variable initialization,  etc. This program was intended
as a learning exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for
industrial practices which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
