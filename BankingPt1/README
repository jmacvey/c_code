-----------------------------------------------------------

The BankingPt1 program is a bank teller simulation program
that uses priority queues to determine the average waiting
time a customer would experience in a real-world banking
environment.  Real data is provided in an input file of the
same style as BankTest1.txt (included in the main file dir-
ectory).  The program uses three classes:  Simulation, Event-
Builder, and Statistics.  The EventBuilder class reads and
stores data from an input file to construct various customer
in/out events.  The Simulation class simulates the events,
and the Statistics class stores statistics regarding those
events (e.g. average waiting time).  The main driver prompts
the user for an input file, and the program proceeds accordingly.
This program uses a single teller. 

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, copy elision,
memory management, etc. This program was intended as a learning
exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for industrial practices
which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
