This directory holds the files for implementations of the
LinkedTree and the BinarySearchTree. This is really the
grand-daddy of recursive data structures, and you'll find
hefty employment of recursive functions for copying,
adding, removing... well, pretty much doing anything, to this
BST.  Much time spent drawing diagrams for this one.  The LinkedTree
is much different than the BST insofar that the nodes are randomly
inserted.  This makes adding things easy, but doing anything
else hard.  I took the liberty to add some functions some
might find interesting (see if the sum of integers along
a LinkedTree Path is a certain number, finding max value in
a random tree, testing to see whether a tree is a BST, etc.). 
All good stuff.  All source is my own, except for the Interface
file (which again I credit to F. Cerrano).  


EXECUTABLE_NAME: TreeTester

Potential reviewers of code should look to the source code and
be able to identify uses of procedural abstraction, recursive
problem solving, user input handling, class relationships,
static variable initialization,  etc. This program was intended
as a learning exercise, and therefore should NOT be used for
industrial practices which may lead to unhandled exceptions.
