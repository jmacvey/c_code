C++_code
This repository contains numerous projects I have completed and/or am currently working on in C++.  The code is largely
for learning purposes and meant to demonstrate my knowledge of native C++, win32, and DirectX API.  Please feel free to use
this code to whichever end you would like.  There is no need to credit me as an author.  Good luck.
