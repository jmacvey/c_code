# c_code
This repository contains numerous projects I have completed and/or am currently working on in C++.  The code is largely meant
for learning purposes and to demonstrate my knowledge of native C++, win32, and DirectX API.  Please feel free to use
this code to whichever end you would like.  For code-specific information, refer to the README in each directory of this repository. 

Some things to note:  
- Some of the code is exception-unsafe.  Don't go incorporating this into programs without some good testing.
- Template code has its implementation in header files. I use syntax [file_name]Impl.h to correspond to [file_name].h
- If others' code shows up in a file, I try to make a note of it in the README, or in comments within that file.  I may miss one or two.  If you notice I missed an "Hail, Petzold", where Petzold is a generic author's name (if you don't know Petzold, you should!), please let me knowPlease email with questions or comments.  
- Makefiles are all hand-written, and some are very primitive.  I go for simple because I like seeing simplified compiler output unmuddled by tools like CMake.  

Any questions just shoot me an e-mail!  Thanks!
