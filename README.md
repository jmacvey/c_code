# c_code
This repository contains numerous projects I have completed and/or am currently working on in C++.  The code is largely meant
for learning purposes and to demonstrate my knowledge of native C++, win32, and DirectX API.  Please feel free to use
this code to whichever end you would like.  For code-specific information, refer to the README in each directory of this repository. Please email with questions or comments.  Thank you!
